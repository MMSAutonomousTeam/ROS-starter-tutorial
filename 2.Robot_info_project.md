# Robot Info System

This is part 2 of the ROS2 tutorials where we will pick up from where we left off in the previous tutorial and we will apply what we have learned so far in a project to tie everything up and connecting all the information together.

This file will cover the following topics:

1. Creating custom messages
2. Creating custom publisher and subscriber
3. Creating custom services
4. Creating config files
5. Creating launch files

Let's not waste anymore time and get started with our project.

## what is our project

This project is all about keeping an eye on the robot’s battery and temperature. Think of it like a health check for your robot!

* It tracks the battery level and temperature.
* It gives a warning if the battery is low or the temperature is too high.
* It lets you reset the battery if it gets too low.
* It sets warning limits so you know when something’s wrong.

Super simple – just a way to make sure the robot stays in good shape!

## lets start

first so we will work on a part of a robot so this part should be done in a package in a workspace to do our work in

### set up the package

```bash
ros2 pkg create robot_info_system --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy std_msgs sensor_msgs
```

#### what does this code do

* **ros2 pkg create**: Tells ROS2 to create a new package.
* **robot_info_system**: Names your package "robot_info_system".
* **--build-type ament_python**:  Specifies that this package is built using Python with the ament build system. This means it’s set up as a Python package, ready for creating and running ROS2 nodes.
* **--dependencies rclpy std_msgs sensor_msgs**: Lists the packages this one depends on (rclpy, std_msgs, sensor_msgs), so they are automatically included.

Now that the package is created, we need to navigate into it. Remember, the package is just a folder containing the necessary libraries and files for ROS2 to work under the hood.

**To move into the package, run:**

```bash
cd robot_info_system 
```

### lets build our project

First, let's think about what we need to do. We want to monitor the **temperature and battery level** of our robot. To do this, we need to get data from sensors that tell us the temperature and battery status. In our system, both values will be represented as **INT numbers**.

Since these two pieces of data don't come in a **standard ROS message**, we have to create a **custom message**. This custom message will let ROS2 know exactly what data to expect (temperature and battery, both as float32) so that our system can understand and work with it.

#### what is the standard ROS message

Standard ROS messages are like ready-made forms for sending data between parts of your robot. Instead of creating your own data format, you can use these pre-built ones. For example, if you need to send a number, you can use the `std_msgs/Float32` message, which is already set up to carry a single floating-point number.

so now lets make our message

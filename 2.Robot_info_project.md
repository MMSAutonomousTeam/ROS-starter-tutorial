# Robot Info System

This is part 2 of the ROS2 tutorials where we will pick up from where we left off in the previous tutorial and we will apply what we have learned so far in a project to tie everything up and connecting all the information together.

This file will cover the following topics:

1. Creating custom messages
2. Creating custom publisher and subscriber
3. Creating custom services
4. Creating config files
5. Creating launch files

Let's not waste anymore time and get started with our project.
